Pkg.add("KrakenEx")
```

- Futures Trading: https://futures.kraken.com/trade/settings/api
- Futures Sandbox: https://demo-futures.kraken.com/settings/api

### 3. Start using the provided example scripts

### 4. Error handling

If any unexpected behavior occurs, please check your API permissions, rate limits, update the KrakenEx.jl, see the [Troubleshooting](@ref) Troubleshooting section, and if the error persits please open an issue on GitHub.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Check if your version of KrakenEx.jl version is the newest.
- Check the permissions of your API keys and the required permissions on the respective endpoints.
- If you get some cloudflare or rate limit errors, please check your Kraken Tier level and maybe apply for a higher rank if required.
- Use different API keys for different algorithms, because the nonce calculation is based on timestamps and a sent nonce must always be the highest nonce ever sent of that API key. Having multiple algorithms using the same keys will result in invalid nonce errors.

## üìù Notes

- Pull requests will be ignored until the owner finished the core idea

- Coding standards are not always followed to make arguments and function names as similar as possible to those in the Kraken API documentations.

- When calling endpoints for examlpe the futures funding endpoint and you submit spaces, braces,... in strings like `" )|] "` a KrakenAuthenticationError will be raised.
